Task ID-011763 -Support(Dilmah)- PRO484 - The PDF output of Iview in the web version has several differences compared to the output generated using Axpert Desktop. Here are the key differences
1. In the web version, the grid lines in the PDF output are not visible, whereas, in the desktop version, grid lines are clearly printed.
2. On the desktop system, only the report headers defined through the Iview properties are printed in the PDF. However, in the web version, the PDF includes all the parameters selected at runtime, which can clutter the report.
3. In the web version, column headers are not repeated on every page when the report spans multiple pages. This feature is available in the desktop version, improving readability for multi-page reports.
