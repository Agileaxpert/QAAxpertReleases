Task ID-012047 -Support(dilmah)- This is regarding the mail approval process. After an action is taken to approve via the email link, the same page reappears after the success message disappears in a few seconds, giving the impression that the approval has not been processed.

If an error occurs, the user should remain on the same page to approve the transaction again.

Task ID-012036 -Support(dilmah)-Dilmah has raised a concern on the usability of downloading header attachments in the form and it needs improvement. Currently, to download an attachment, the user must carefully hover over the designated area to trigger a popup displaying the attachments. Then, they must quickly move to the popup and click on the desired attachment. However, the popup is highly sensitive—if the cursor moves slightly away from the links, it closes immediately.

Task ID-012016 -Support(Itech)-In the params section, there is a multiselect option where users can select multiple values. Currently, all selected values, even up to 100, are displayed once the params are applied, making the UI cluttered and visually unappealing. To improve this, they request that only the first 3–4 selected values be shown, followed by an ellipsis (...) to indicate additional selections. A UI fix is needed to implement this enhancement. Please find the following link to access the screenshot for your reference.
