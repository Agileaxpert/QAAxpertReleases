TASK-0636 -JFI- Issue Details: The Clone functionality is not resetting the Doc ID to Auto immediately after cloning a document. Instead, it temporarily retains the original document’s Doc ID, which causes confusion for users. Although the Doc ID gets updated correctly after saving the cloned transaction, it is not reflected instantly. During this interim period, the unchanged Doc ID appears in the form and the list view, misleading users into thinking the original document is being modified.

TASK-0690 -QA- During login, the error message was coming as 'Invalid username/ Password' instead of the error message 'Inactive user' when inactive users are trying to login.
