TASK-1128 -BMRCL- Custom HTML home page performance issue

TASK-0997 -BAFCO- As current SSO requirement mandates that the username in the axusers table must be the user's email ID, we request a feature to use the existing username in axusers table to be used as login through SSO instead of email ID. 
Please note the following points for SSO login enabled Users:
1. EmailID is mandatory in 'AxUsers' table in 'Email' column and it should be unique. 
2. Once Axpert Application Authenticated with SSO, then value in 'UserName' column will be used for further identification of the loggedin User for that particular session.

1. Usernames can be enumerated by manipulating the “axPassword” and “hdnPuser” parameters in the request, indicating insufficient access control mechanisms. Additionally, login attempts using a default password for the enumerated users resulted in a response stating “User not activated” confirming user enumeration is possible without proper account protection.
   Note: UserName and Password has been handled through encryption to avoid tampering.				
2. The default Internet Information Services (IIS) page is exposed, as shown  below.
