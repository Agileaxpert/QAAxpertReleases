This application supports an optional "AllowedDomains" setting in appsettings.json to control CORS.

{
...,
	"AllowedDomains": [
		"https://agileqa.agilecloud.biz",
		"https://server2.test.bh"
	]
}

1) If AllowedDomains is missing or empty
	* Only same domain/origin urls will be supported.
	* AxpertWeb and ARMNotificationHub should be from same domain URL.
	
2) If AllowedDomains is present
	* Listed domain URLs are allowed 
	* Works when AxpertWeb and ARMNotificationHub are from different URLs.
	
CheckList:
* Domain name should be exact with proper http/https as well. 
* Also there should not be / at the end:
